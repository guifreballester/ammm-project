INSTRUCTIONS OF USE
-------------------


Each implementation is inside their own respective folder, meaning that the OPL implementation is inside the OPL folder
and the GRASP implementation in the GRASP folder and so on...

In the case of both the GRASP and the BRKGA they can be tested by using the * heurisitics.py * module.

If the module is launched it will prompt the user with some questions and then will execute either GRASP or BRKGA
depending on what the user wants with the parameters he/she wishes.


EXAMPLE OF USE
